groupplayer
===========

GroupPlayer is a simple AngularFire application to allow a group of people to separately contribute to a video playlist.
- Video links (currently youtube) can be added to the list (green plus button), and the app will automatically play/remove them.
- It's also possible to manually remove undesired videos from the list (red minus button).
- If the autoplay doesn't work, there's a "Force Next" button that will load the next item.

The firebase account is "free" tier, so if it might be prudent to fork the project and change the firebase to a personal one.
